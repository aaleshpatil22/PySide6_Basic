## Introduction

This project showcases the implementation of a PySide6 application with a QPushButton, demonstrating the usage of signals such as `clicked`, `pressed`, and `released`. The application features a QWidget with a QPushButton and prints messages to the console when the button is clicked, pressed, or released.

## Project Structure

- **/QPushButton/main.py**: The main Python script that creates the PySide6 application using QPushButton.
- **/QPushButton/README.md**: Documentation file providing information about the project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aaleshpatil22/PySide6_Basic.git
   cd PySide6_Basic/QPushButton
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python and PySide6 installed:

   ```bash
   pip install PySide6
   ```

## Usage

Run the `main.py` script to launch the PySide6 application:

```bash
python main.py
```

Explore the PySide6 application with a QPushButton, click the button, and observe the console output for messages related to the button's signals.

## Features
