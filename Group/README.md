## Introduction

This project showcases the implementation of a PySide6 application utilizing the QGroupBox element to organize QCheckBox and QRadioButton widgets. The application features two QGroupBox containers: one for operating systems (OS) selection and another for drink options.

## Project Structure

- **main.py**: The main Python script that creates the PySide6 application using QGroupBox.
- **README.md**: Documentation file providing information about the project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aaleshpatil22/PySide6_Basic.git
   cd PySide6_Basic/Group
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python and PySide6 installed:

   ```bash
   pip install PySide6
   ```

## Usage

Run the `main.py` script to launch the PySide6 application:

```bash
python main.py
```

Explore the simple PySide6 application with QGroupBox containers containing QCheckBox and QRadioButton widgets.

## Features

- Use of QGroupBox to group related QCheckBox and QRadioButton widgets.
- Connection of a slot method (`window_clicked`) to a QCheckBox toggle event.
