## Introduction

This project showcases the implementation of a PySide6 application utilizing the QPixmap element to display an image on a QLabel. The application features a QWidget containing a QLabel that loads and displays an image using QPixmap.

## Project Structure

- **main.py**: The main Python script that creates the PySide6 application using QPixmap.
- **README.md**: Documentation file providing information about the project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aaleshpatil22/PySide6_Basic.git
   cd PySide6_Basic/Image
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python and PySide6 installed:

   ```bash
   pip install PySide6
   ```

## Usage

1. Place an image file (e.g., `download.jpeg`) in the same directory as `main.py`.
2. Run the `main.py` script to launch the PySide6 application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

Explore the PySide6 application with a QLabel displaying the loaded image using QPixmap.

## Features

- Usage of QPixmap to load and display an image on a QLabel.
