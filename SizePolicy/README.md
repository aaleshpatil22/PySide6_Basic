# PySide6 QSizePolicy Example

This project demonstrates the usage of the QSizePolicy element in PySide6, a Python binding for the Qt framework. The `main.py` file creates a simple PySide6 application with a QWidget containing QLabel, QLineEdit, and QPushButton elements, each utilizing QSizePolicy.

## Introduction

This project showcases the implementation of a PySide6 application utilizing the QSizePolicy element to control the size policy of QLabel, QLineEdit, and QPushButton elements. The application features a QWidget with a QLabel and a QLineEdit in a horizontal layout, and three QPushButton elements in a horizontal layout, demonstrating the usage of QSizePolicy.

## Project Structure

- **/policy/main.py**: The main Python script that creates the PySide6 application using QSizePolicy.
- **/policy/README.md**: Documentation file providing information about the project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aaleshpatil22/PySide6_Basic.git
   cd PySide6_Basic/policy
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python and PySide6 installed:

   ```bash
   pip install PySide6
   ```

## Usage

Run the `main.py` script to launch the PySide6 application:

```bash
python main.py
```

Explore the PySide6 application with QLabel, QLineEdit, and QPushButton elements demonstrating the usage of QSizePolicy.

## Features

- Usage of QSizePolicy to control the size policy of QLabel, QLineEdit, and QPushButton elements.
- Demonstrates the configuration of size policy with a fixed width for QLineEdit and proportional size distribution for QPushButton elements.
